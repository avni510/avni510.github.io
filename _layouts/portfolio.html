          I am currently working as a ML Researcher/ Data Scientist with <a class="description" style="color:#33A8FF" href="https://www.jeanfeng.com/"> Jean Feng</a>
          at UCSF to help research and deploy ML algorithms for Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. 
          My research focuses on safety in machine learning from the perspective of 1) making machine learning models transparent 
          and aligned with human intuition in high stakes settings, and 2) ensuring equitable and fair ML models by detecting individuals subject to preclusion.

          I recently graduated from my Master's  in Computer Science at UC San Diego where I was named a
          <a class="description" style="color:#33A8FF" href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/about/news/newest-deep-minds-uc-san-diegos-cse"> DeepMind Fellow</a>.
          At UCSD I worked with <a class="description" style="color:#33A8FF" href="https://www.berkustun.com/">Berk Ustun </a>
          and <a class="description" style="color:#33A8FF" href="https://lilyweng.github.io/">Lily Weng </a> in algorithmic recourse.

          Previously, I was a software engineer creating web-applications in education and healthcare. 
          <!-- Before that, I received my Bachelors in Mathematics and Economics from UT Austin. -->
          Outside of work you can usually find me biking or enjoying the outdoors.
