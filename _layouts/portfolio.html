          I'm a recent Master's graduate in Computer Science at UC San Diego (on the job market!) where I was named a <a class="description" style="color:#33A8FF" href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/about/news/newest-deep-minds-uc-san-diegos-cse"> DeepMind Fellow</a>. 
          I did research with <a class="description" style="color:#33A8FF" href="https://www.berkustun.com/">Berk Ustun </a>
          and <a class="description" style="color:#33A8FF" href="https://lilyweng.github.io/">Lily Weng </a> in algorithimc recourse.
          I am broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning, and more specifically in algorithmic fairness, algorithmic recourse, and data privacy.
          Previously, I was a software engineer creating web-applications in education and healthcare. Before that, I received
          my Bachelors in Mathematics and and Economics from UT Austin.
          Outside of school you can usually find me biking or enjoying the outdoors in San Diego.
