I use this blog a learning tool to help me understand and digest new concepts. Here's a bit about me:

I graduated in May 2016 from the University of Texas at Austin where I studied mathematics and economics and minored in computer science. 
I use to work as a software engineer at 8th Light for about 3 years. I enjoy learning about the intersections between math and computer science. 

In my free time you can find me biking, reading, and watching movies.
