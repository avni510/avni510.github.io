This blog documents my time as a resident apprentice at 8th Light. Here's a bit about me: 
    
I graduated in May 2016 from the University of Texas at Austin where I studied mathematics and economics and minored in computer science. During my last year of college I did an internship in Austin with the software engineering team with a company called OwnLocal. This helped me decide that I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering. Soon after I applied to 8th Light where I then proceeded to complete my student apprenticeship. I'm currently working as a resident apprentice at 8th Light.
