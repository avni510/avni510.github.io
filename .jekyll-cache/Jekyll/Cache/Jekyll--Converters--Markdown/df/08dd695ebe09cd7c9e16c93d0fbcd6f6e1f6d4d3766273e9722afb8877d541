I"²<p>Interpretation and compilation are implementations of a language rather than a property of a language. It is, in fact, not correct to say a specific language is compiled. A language can either be executed through a compiler or interpreter, itâ€™s just a matter of implementation. For example, Python code is usually executed through an interpreter, but it is also possible to create a compiler to execute the same Python code.</p>
