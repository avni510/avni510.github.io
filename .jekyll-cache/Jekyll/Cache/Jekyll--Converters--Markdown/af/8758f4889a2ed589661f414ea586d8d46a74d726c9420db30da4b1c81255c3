I"²<p>Threads are something used by computer programs. A single thread is responsible for a set of instructions that together perform a specific task. It controls what is executed in a specific order. A thread also allows the capability of context switching away from it and resuming it from the point where it left off. The actual execution of instructions happens in the CPU. The thread just holds the instructions for a specific task. In a single threaded application, if you want to execute 10 different tasks you have to wait for each task to finish before starting the next task. This can cause problems if one task is slowed down or blocked, the remaining tasks cannot be executed.</p>
