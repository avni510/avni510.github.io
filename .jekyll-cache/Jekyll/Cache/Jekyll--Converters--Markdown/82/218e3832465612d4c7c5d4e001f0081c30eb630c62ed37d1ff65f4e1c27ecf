I"!<p>The Enumerable Module is a mixin. The methods from the module are used in the Array and Hash classes. You can actually use the Enumerable module in any of your classes as long as you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#each</code> defined. All the methods in the module create a new data structure - ex: an array or hash - and the old one is not mutated. You would want to use the methods from the Enumerable module when you are iterating through a collection of objects and manipulating the data in that collection.</p>
