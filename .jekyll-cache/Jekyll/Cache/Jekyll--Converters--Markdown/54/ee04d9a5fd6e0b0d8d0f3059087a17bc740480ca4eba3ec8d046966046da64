I"g<p>My post a few weeks ago about implementing minimax in Clojure was written in a linear recursive way. Another way to write the same algothrim is in a tail recursive manner. Both have their pluses and minuses which Iâ€™ll discuss further into the post. But I want to go through a brief explantation on how to think about this algothrim tail recursively.</p>
