I"„<p>Symbols in Clojure are frequently used. Clojure.org states that symbols are used to â€œrefer to function parameters, let bindings, class names, and global varsâ€. Essentially symbols are a piece of data. Symbols are not storage locations, but instead they are used to refer to the value of a variable. It can also be said that symbols are used as identifiers within the language.</p>
