I"x<p>In order to have a better understanding of how redux works and the benefits of it I decided to rebuild it with some slight modifications 
inspired by one of my mentors. This post does assume knowledge of the basics of redux. It will go into the implementation of redux and hopefully clarify 
any questions you may have about how it works.  I didn’t embark on rebuilding all the parts
like middleware, but I wanted to rebuild the bulk of it. I decided to use Typescript which is what the original redux is written in. 
This post will go through explaining how it works and some of the benefits I saw to this model. 
I’ll also go through the tests written for it
so that you will be able to see how it’s used. The code and tests can be found <a href="https://github.com/avni510/react-website">here</a> under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/state/</code></p>
