Last week I had the opportunity to pair with Mike and Kristin on AXUS. I realized that AXUS was a large project with thousands of users, which meant a lot more code and a more complex system. Compared to the previous pairing projects I was on, AXUS is live. So after pushing up to master there's a deploy process. With only two developers on a large scale project, it led to a very different workflow than I had seen before. There was constant context switching, and they were both managing the responsibility of working on new features and handling support issues. If a support issue was urgent they would usually leave whatever they were working on to handle the support issue and then go back to the feature they were working on. This made it hard to estimate and communicate when a story would be completed. 

I noticed both of them frequently checking and keeping up with the different channels of communication like slack and email. These are usually how the support issues would be communicated, so it was important to check them often. But this also led to another thing to juggle. 

As far as the technical part, I noticed we were in different parts of the system all day. Sometimes we would be working in the code base, but often times we would also be working with the database, AWS, and other tools. I found it interesting to see and learn about all these parts.

From AXUS I mainly took away that context switching is hard, but necessary for some clients. Both Mike and Kristin are really good at switching back and forth, and it was great to learn from them.
