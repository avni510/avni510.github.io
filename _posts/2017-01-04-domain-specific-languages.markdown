For my first assignment at 8th Light I am asked to convert my command line time logger application to a web based version. I have been asked to implement the web app in Sinatra which is a domain specific language (DSL). Although I have been using domain specific languages for awhile I wanted to dive deeper into their formal defintion in this blogpost. A DSL is like a mini computer language used to solve a specific task. They are officially not a computer language because they don't satsify the requirements of being Turing Complete. So in some ways they are less powerful than a general language like Python or C. But they can often be more concise and helpful than a general language to complete certain tasks. Examples include SQL and Regex. SQL is related to solving problems related to tables and their relationships, and Regex is related to matching strings. Both have very specific purposes. Sinatra's purpose is solely related to web applications which is why its methods are related to HTTP requests.
