I had the opportunity to pair with Kevin the last few days on Kentech. I was pairing with him for a longer time than with any of my other pairs, so I had a chance to get more familiar with the project. So far, I've been working on the project with him for about 4 days. The project, Clarity, is an application built with React for the front end and Phoenix for the back end. This is the first project that I've paired on where a crafter is working solo. And with this specific client there is no development team, so Kevin is working on his own. He has been getting some help from Studio Services and a contractor, but for the most part major features and decisions are implemented and executed by him. Working solo brings its own set of challenges, but I also found it interesting that Kevin is also playing a project manager role with the client as well due to the lack of a development team. Managing client expectations for how much can be completely is one of challenges Kevin mentioned he's facing. 

Kentech has many features they would like to implement, but as Kevin is the only full time developer on the project it becomes very difficult to complete all the features requested. I noticed that Kevin has learnt to work quickly and he's great at prioritizing what features are important to work on and others that may just need to be a prototype for the client to see. The prototype features can be tweaked and fully worked through after the client has given Kevin feedback. That is something I rarely thought about during my apprenticeship, as I was more so focused on the code rather than on the practically of it. Although, on this project I realized how important it is to think back to the practicality and use case of a feature. 

From a technical perspective, the project was designed from scratch by 8th
Light. So it was neat to learn from a well designed project. Design and testing
strategies used on the project were all great exposures for me to see a
different perspective.
