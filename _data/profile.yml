    company : AI/ML Engineer; University of California, San Francisco - San Francisco, CA
    description_1: Architected and led end-to-end development of a GPT 4o-powered patient summary system in collaboration with 5+ clinicians and social workers, generating concise summaries for patients with 20+ (20000+ tokens) clinical notes to improve patient outcomes
    description_2: Established and led human annotation pipelines with social workers to validate LLM-generated summaries, then implemented automated evaluation frameworks with LLM-as-a-judge to scale across 100+ patient records 
    description_3: Developed and authored a publication for a multimodal ML pipeline to integrate tabular and unstructured clinical data to improve black-box model interpretability, delivering 7% AUC improvement in readmission risk prediction 
    description_4: Created and presented a hybrid LLM-empirical framework combining Llama 2's clinical knowledge with EHR data, achieving 40% interpretability improvement (validated by clinical experts) while matching top predictive performance and enabling production deployment
    description_5: Designed and deployed a scalable ETL pipeline to process health record data, enabling ML training and evaluation for 3K+ patient records and 30K+ patient visits
    description_6: Engineered, deployed, and evaluated a custom clinical risk prediction model adopted by 10+ clinics, achieving 12% higher accuracy than the general clinical model 
  - start: June 2022
    end: Mar 2024
    company : ML Engineer; University of California, SD; CA
    description_1: Designed and developed a model agnostic auditing method and procedure to detect scenarios of bias for decision making models in high stakes settings
    description_2: Experimented with different models and datasets to identify scenarios of bias for up to 30% of a lending dataset 
    description_3: Authored a publication that received an ICLR Spotlight  (Top 5% among submissions)
    description_4: Collaborated with a lending expert to define 25+ real-world constraints on lending datasets to identify individuals subject to preclusion

    company : Software Engineer; Edovo - Chicago, IL
    description_1: Architected, tested, and deployed an educational content platform using Elasticsearch to handle 700K+ requests per day 
    description_2: Led 10+ requirement gathering sessions with Product owners to re-build a platform 
    description_3: Created a data pipeline and job to merge 4B rows of user event data in PostgreSQL 
  - start: Aug 2017
    end: March 2019
    company : Lead Software Engineer; 8th Light - Chicago, IL
    description_1: Implemented and deployed a scalable load testing platform simulating 1000+ RPS 
    description_2: Engineered API integrations to sync 1000+ interactions/ minute in different timezones
