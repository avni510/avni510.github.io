    company : Research Engineer; University of California, San Francisco - San Francisco, CA
    description_1: Developed a multimodal method to improve interpretability of black box models by generating and refining concept bottleneck models within a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification, outperforming baseline methods by 35%
    description_2: Created a method to use a Bayesian tree based model that merges Llama 2â€™s domain knowledge with empirical data, increasing interpretability by 40%, as confirmed by domain experts, while matching top predictive performance and quantifying risk 
    description_3: Designed and deployed a scalable ETL pipeline to process health record data, enabling ML training and evaluation for 3K+ patient records and 30K+ patient visits 
    description_4: Built, deployed, and evaluated a custom clinical risk prediction model adopted by 10+ clinics, achieving 12% higher accuracy than the general clinical model 
    description_5: Mentored 5+ peers and PhD students through teaching sessions and code reviews
