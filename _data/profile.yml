    company : AI/ML Engineer; University of California, San Francisco - San Francisco, CA
    description_1: Architected and deployed clinical AI systems to save social workers 300+ hours/ week, identify patients at risk for readmission, and create simple, interpretable models from multimodal patient data 
    description_2: Drove end-to-end architecture of a GPT 4o powered clinical summarization pilot to condense patient charts (20K+ tokens) into actionable summaries, co-developed with 5+ clinicians to improve patient care
    description_3: Established and led human and automated annotation pipelines with active learning to ensure 90%+ accuracy on 1000+ GPT 4o clinical summaries
    description_4: Designed and deployed a scalable ETL pipeline to process health record data, enabling ML training and evaluation for 3000+ patient records and 30000+ patient visits
    description_5: Engineered, deployed, and evaluated a custom readmission risk prediction model, adopted by 10+ clinics, with 12% higher accuracy than the general model 
    description_6: Created and presented a hybrid LLM-empirical framework to reconcile clinical LLM hallucinations, achieving 40% interpretability improvement (validated by clinical experts) while matching top predictive performance and enabling production deployment
    description_7: Developed and authored a publication for a multimodal ML pipeline to integrate tabular and unstructured clinical data to improve black-box model interpretability, delivering 7% AUC improvement in readmission risk prediction
